Starting with January 2023, my goal is to ship 12 products in 12 months.

# Why not focus on one product?
My goal is not to create the next [unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)), but rather to learn as much as I can about the technologies I'm interested in, while increasing my ability to [always be shipping](https://blog.codinghorror.com/yes-but-what-have-you-done/).

# Learning Goals
